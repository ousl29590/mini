                <p>Sri Lanka is an island in the Indian Ocean and lies southeast of India. The country
                is known for its vast plains and impressive mountain tops, tea plantations,
                and beautiful temples. The island was formerly known as Ceylon, 
                a name which is still used for the tea that comes from Sri Lanka.
                The country is relatively rich compared to nearby India. Regardless,
                one fifth of the population lives below the poverty line.
                The economy of Sri Lanka is primarily centered around the export of 
                coffee, clothes, rubber and coconuts. In recent years, 
                tourism has become an increasingly important source of income.
                More and more tourists are discovering the beauty of the island.         
                This is in part due to the falling prices of flight tickets, 
                but also due to better facilities for tourists.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2>History</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p>Sri Lanka has been inhabited since prehistoric times. 
                    The oldest human remains found there date from roughly 125,000 years ago.
                    In prehistoric times, the island was inhabited by the Weddas.
                    During the European Middle Ages, the Tamil gradually made their way from South India to the north of Sri Lanka,
                    where they established a kingdom in the 11th century.
                    It is likely that the ancestors of the Singalese, 
                    the largest ethnic group in Sri Lanka,
                    came to Sri Lanka from North India around the 5th or 6th century B.C. 
                    They lived alongside the Tamil,
                    although relations between the two groups were complex and not always peaceful.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The first Europeans to arrive in Sri Lanka were he Portugese in 1505.
                        
                     They stayed until 1658. In 1602, the Dutch Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC) was created,
                     and the Dutch also sailed to Sri Lanka. In 1638, the king of Kandy asked the VOC for help: 
                     he wanted the support of the Dutch against the Portugese.
                     The VOC provided this support in exchange for an exclusive trade contract.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p>The influence of the VOC quickly spread,
                     and by 1658 the whole of Sri Lanka was under Dutch rule. However, 
                     the agreed upon deals were not respected by both parties.
                     A large amount of modernisation took place in the country, 
                     such as the construction os canals for the transport of good,    
                     but this was done in part through oppression. 
                     The Protestant Dutch did not bother the Buddhist,
                     Hindu and Muslims parts of the populations, 
                     but the Catholics and the remaining Portugese colonists were persecuted.
                     Addtionally, the population was forced to pay the Dutch colonists higher taxes
                     compared to the old Portugese rulers.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p>In 1796, the British invaded Sri Lanka and in 1802 Sri Lanka became a
                     British colony known as Ceylon. On 4 February 1948,
                     Sri Lanka became independent under the name Dominion Ceylon,
                     and in 1972 this name was changed to Sri Lanka. From 1983 until 2009, 
                     a violent civil war occured in Sri Lanka between the Tamils and the Singalese,
                     causing the deaths of tens of thousands of people.</p>
